    "# Distance Metrics - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll calculate various distances between multiple points using the distance metrics you learned about!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate Manhattan distance between two points \n",
    "- Calculate Euclidean distance between two points\n",
    "- Calculate Minkowski distance between two points\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll start by writing a generalized function to calculate any of the three distance metrics you've learned about. Let's review what you know so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The **_Manhattan distance_** and **_Euclidean distance_** are both special cases of **_Minkowski distance_**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the formula for Minkowski distance below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large d(x,y) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_i - y_i|^c\\right)^\\frac{1}{c}$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "**_Manhattan distance_** is a special case where $c=1$ in the equation above (which means that you can remove the root operation and just keep the summation).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**_Euclidean distance_** is a special case where $c=2$ in the equation above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing this, you can create a generalized `distance()` function that calculates Minkowski distance, and takes in `c` as a parameter. That way, you can use the same function for every problem, and still calculate Manhattan and Euclidean distance metrics by just passing in the appropriate values for the `c` parameter!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Complete the `distance()` function which should implement the Minkowski distance equation above to return the distance, a single number  \n",
    "* This function should take in 4 arguments:\n",
    "    * `a`: a tuple or array that describes a vector in n-dimensional space  \n",
    "    * `b`: a tuple or array that describes a vector in n-dimensional space (this must be the same length as `a`!)\n",
    "    * `c`: which tells us the norm to calculate the vector space (if set to `1`, the result will be Manhattan, while `2` will calculate Euclidean distance) \n",
    "    * `verbose`: set to `True` by default. If true, the function should print out if the distance metric returned is a measurement of Manhattan, Euclidean, or Minkowski distance \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Since euclidean distance is the most common distance metric used, this function should default to using `c=2` if no value is set for `c` \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**_HINT:_** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can avoid using a `for` loop like we did in the previous lesson by simply converting the tuples to NumPy arrays \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use `np.power()` as an easy way to implement both squares and square roots. `np.power(a, 3)` will return the cube of `a`, while `np.power(a, 1/3)` will return the cube root of 3. For more information on this function, refer the [NumPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/generated/numpy.power.html)!"
