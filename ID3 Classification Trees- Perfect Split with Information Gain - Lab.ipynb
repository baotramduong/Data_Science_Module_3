    "# ID3 Classification Trees: Perfect Split with Information Gain - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will simulate the example from the previous lesson in Python. You will write functions to calculate entropy and IG which will be used for calculating these uncertainty measures and deciding upon creating a split using information gain while growing an ID3 classification tree. You will also write a general function that can be used for other (larger) problems as well. So let's get on with it.\n",
